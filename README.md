# GraphPage - Graph Visualization Tool

GraphPage is a React-based application designed to visualize graphs using the Havel-Hakimi algorithm. Users can input a sequence of degrees, and the application will determine whether the sequence is graphical and display the corresponding graph.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphpage.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd graphpage

# Install dependencies
npm install  # or yarn install
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Available Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page reloads automatically on file changes.
```sh
npm start
```

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
```sh
npm test
```

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build/` folder, optimizing for best performance.
```sh
npm run build
```

### `npm run eject`
This exposes configuration files for further customization. **Warning: This is irreversible!**
```sh
npm run eject
```

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- ðŸ“Š **Graphical Sequence Validation**: Determines whether a degree sequence is graphical.
- ðŸ”„ **Real-time Visualization**: Uses D3.js to display the resulting graph dynamically.
- ðŸ“œ **Logging Panel**: Displays step-by-step Havel-Hakimi algorithm execution.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI**: Styled with CSS for an elegant and responsive design.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- React.js
- D3.js (for graph visualization)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (custom styling for UI improvements)
